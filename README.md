#### Abstract

Our group decided to research the topic of “Fake News” on Facebook and how much it is shared and reacted to. We stumbled upon this dataset on Kaggle, and with the 2020 election approaching we thought analyzing a topic like this would be both relevant and informative. We hope we can shed light on how easily false information can be spread through Facebook and encourage people to be cautious of the information they read.

Our dataset comes from Kaggle, and contains one csv file with over 2000 data points. The source of the data is from BuzzFeed News, who analyzed stories from hyperpartisan political Facebook pages. These pages contain right and left wing sources and mainstream news sites, giving us a great mix of viewpoints. The dataset can be found at the following link:
